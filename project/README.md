FINAL PROJECT FOR CS50 2020

This project is a web-based application that will give communities from
all over the world a tool to help people deal with the scourge of potholes.
People from winter states know all too well just how miserable it is to drive
on torn up and pothole ridden roads. Meanwhile, leadership gives the same old
tired answer; there's not enough money. This application intends to help motivate
our elected officials by providing them with accurate information on all the
potholes in the community. What will be recorded:

Location
Size
Duration of existence
General inconveience

This information will be collected by the people of a community and then published
for anyone to see. Users will be able to see the condition of the roads at any location on
the map. With this data out in the open, our leadership and community will be spurred to
action, and better roads will come.

The application will utilize the MVC system. Users will be greeted with an HTML page
that will register the user with their personal data and set-up their login info. This
information will be stored in a table in a database. The following HTML pages will provide
the user an opportunity to enter the data mentioned above in regards to potholes in their
neighborhood into a database. The total of this data will be properly organized and then presented to
the user for their benefit. All of this will be controlled by a Flask/Python application.

Additional features:

Voting system for established potholes
Crowd funding
Easily exportable data
