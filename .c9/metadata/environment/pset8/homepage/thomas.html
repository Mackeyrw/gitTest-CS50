His name occurs in all the lists of the Synoptists (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6, cf. Acts 1:13), but in St. John he plays a distinctive part. First, when Jesus announced His intention of returning to Judea to visit Lazarus, \"Thomas\" who is called Didymus [the twin], said to his fellow disciples: \"Let us also go, that we may die with him\" (John 11:16). Again it was St. Thomas who during the discourse before the Last Supper raised an objection: \"Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?\" (John 14:5). But more especially St. Thomas is remembered for his incredulity when the other Apostles announced Christ's Resurrection to him: \"Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe\" (John 20:25); but eight days later he made his act of faith, drawing down the rebuke of Jesus: \"Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed\" (John 20:29)."],"id":29}],[{"start":{"row":17,"column":1230},"end":{"row":17,"column":1231},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":30}],[{"start":{"row":17,"column":1231},"end":{"row":17,"column":1232},"action":"insert","lines":["("],"id":31},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1232},"end":{"row":17,"column":1233},"action":"insert","lines":["n"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1233},"end":{"row":17,"column":1234},"action":"insert","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1234},"end":{"row":17,"column":1235},"action":"insert","lines":["w"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1235},"end":{"row":17,"column":1236},"action":"insert","lines":["a"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1236},"end":{"row":17,"column":1237},"action":"insert","lines":["d"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1237},"end":{"row":17,"column":1238},"action":"insert","lines":["v"]}],[{"start":{"row":17,"column":1238},"end":{"row":17,"column":1239},"action":"insert","lines":["e"],"id":32},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1239},"end":{"row":17,"column":1240},"action":"insert","lines":["n"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1240},"end":{"row":17,"column":1241},"action":"insert","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1241},"end":{"row":17,"column":1242},"action":"insert","lines":["."]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1242},"end":{"row":17,"column":1243},"action":"insert","lines":["o"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1243},"end":{"row":17,"column":1244},"action":"insert","lines":["r"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1244},"end":{"row":17,"column":1245},"action":"insert","lines":["g"]},{"start":{"row":17,"column":1245},"end":{"row":17,"column":1246},"action":"insert","lines":[")"]}],[{"start":{"row":18,"column":14},"end":{"row":19,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":33},{"start":{"row":19,"column":0},"end":{"row":19,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["        "]}],[{"start":{"row":19,"column":8},"end":{"row":25,"column":14},"action":"insert","lines":["<nav aria-label=\"Page navigation example\">","          <ul class=\"pagination\">","            <li class=\"page-item\"><a class=\"page-link\" href='mary.html'>1</a></li>","            <li class=\"page-item\"><a class=\"page-link\" href='patrick.html'>2</a></li>","            <li class=\"page-item\"><a class=\"page-link\" href='thomas.html'>3</a></li>","          </ul>","        </nav>"],"id":34}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":25,"column":14},"end":{"row":25,"column":14},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1584133269492,"hash":"ba0119f2859b80f43880423c4f58914bb987f7f8"}
